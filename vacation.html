      <p class="bg-warning">Tourism is a vital industry for New York City, which has witnessed a growing combined volume of international and domestic tourists, receiving a sixth consecutive record of nearly 60 million visitors in 2015.[52] Tourism had generated an all-time high US$61.3 billion in overall economic impact for New York City in 2014,[52] pending 2015 statistics. Approximately 12 million visitors to New York City were from outside the United States, with the highest numbers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, and China. According to the website reuters.com, "New York City tourism climb[ed] record high in 2015 for [the] sixth year."</p>
      <p class="bg-info">
        I Love New York (stylized I ‚ù§ NY) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City,[337] and later to promote New York State as well. The trademarked logo, owned by New York State Empire State Development,[338] appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state, some licensed, many not. The song is the state song of New York.
